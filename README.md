This is the the blog of a developer constantly learning how to code.

The posts I write are about what I learn in my day to day. When I write, I realize that it is easier for me to retain information and understand it.

On the way, maybe one of my posts can help someone like me, so I share them through this blog.

The main language of the entries is Spanish, but there may also be other posts in English.
